			       This game runs too slow to be playable. The graphics look really good. The Audio does work, but I would recommend that you disable it because it is too choppy to be enjoyable. The in-game map &amp; writing is not shown correctly. To help counter the speed issue, you might want to set Frameskip to 1+.

			  Setting Texture Update Check to Every Frame fixes the graphical problems with the text in the menu. Both Sync and Async audio work, but are choppy. The graphics in-game look good, much better than the menu. Once you begin to sumo in-game, the game will freeze, and all options i tried to bypass this freeze failed. When the game cuts out though, if you have either audio type Enabled, the sound will continue to play fullspeed. The speeds in-game are a bit slow, so set Frameskip to 1.also tried various settings but game doesnt seem to work fine...

The graphics are very vivid and colorful, and the game gives off a Paper Mario type feeling. Both Sync and Async audio work quite well, and if you want to enable audio, then I'd recommend Async because I did not experience any crashes with it enabled and Async if faster than Sync. Keep audio Disabled for you are looking for more speed. Also set Frameskip to Auto. The game was running at 50%+ sync for a majority of my gameplay.

			      Splash screen before menu is washed out. The only other graphical glitch is that the cursor does not show in-game, so this inhibits gameplay a bit. The controls are a bit hard to grasp. The game runs over fullspeed with either Sync or Async sound enabled, so you might want to turn on Limit Framerate.

On training levels, it's very playable (15-25fps), but in the main game - with vast environments and fleets of allies/enemies - it crawls to a frustratingly slow average of 6fps.

There are a few minor graphical errors, and in-game there is a yellow tint that sometimes finds it's way onto the screen, but it does not prevent gameplay at all. The sound works, but is better left off. I would recommend that you set Frameskip to Auto.

			 When playing you might want to set Frameskip to Auto because when you are in a Grand Prix, there is a bit of a speed decrease. You also might want to Limit the Framerate because some parts run too fast. Both Sync and Async work, but have the traditional choppiness whenever the framerate is below 100%. The graphics look very good, and I didn't notice anything bugs or glitches,which is the most best part of the game:)

			The graphics look great, but the game runs painfully slow. Culling and Clean Scene seems to fix most, if not all graphics issues. Both Sync and Async audio work, but are choppy, so it should remain disabled because you need to try and bore out all of the speed possible. I would definitely recommend setting Frameskip to 1+. The in-game movies actually run quite fast, and are appealing to watch with the dramatic variety of colors.

			  The graphics look good, and it only has a few inexact blend modes. Both Sync and Async sound work, but it is choppy and slows it down to 7 fps. The menu works near fullspeed, but it is very slow in game. Frameskip makes the game unenjoyable, but you still might want to turn it on to get a nice speed-up. The game runs on a 15fps full speed, so reaching 10fps is the equivalent to reaching 2/3 speed.

*Sometimes, the rider falls through floor, but hey appear back on the map in a few seconds.

*When the game starts you freefall through the level (which allows you to gain 30k points XD ), after about 5 minutes it stabilizes and you can land on the floor, this happens again though after jumping and starting another trick.

This game is slow but is still playable.

			The Intro boots up, but once you are about to get to the main menu, you experience a BSOD. Please note that if you do not have Dynamic Loop Optimization Disabled, the game hangs right after the Konami logo flashes. Both Sync, and Async audio do work on the intro, but it is choppy. i would recommend that you set Frameskip to Auto because the intro becomes slow at some points.

			 Make sure to turn on Limit Framerate, so the game doesn't run too fast. This game runs just about perfectly. The game now plays sound, but only Sync works. Async will BSOD the game. With sound enabled, the speed is still 85-95+% sync, but it may be a good idea to turn on Frameskip to Auto 1. The speed in game with default settings is 95%+ sync, and is very enjoyable. Leave Audio Match Rate off as it cuts the speed in half.

			   The graphics seem to be perfect, but the game itself is very slow. It usually runs around 30%-40% sync in-game. Both Sync and Async audio work, but should be left Disabled because it is very choppy, and slows down gameplay. I would highly recommend that Frameskip be set to 1 to help the slow speeds, but this also creates laggy graphics so whatever you would rather have.

			 The amount of fps depends on how many things are being rendered on-screen. You need to have Double Display Lists Enabled, or else there is a ghosting effect. There seems to be a pale tint to the green soldiers, but does not hurt gameplay whatsoever. Both Sync and Async audio fail to play, so you can leave audio Disabled. I would recommend that you set Frameskip to 1 to help gain some speed. Other than the speed, this game is quite fun to play.

			 The fps varies greatly during gameplay, and is directly proportional to the amount of objects being rendered on the screen. The graphics look perfect. Both Sync and Async audio do work, but they're very choppy and unpleasant. If you want to enable audio, then Async audio would be better because it only costs about 1fps. You might need to set Frameskip to 1 to try to gain a bit more speed, but graphics become jumpy and laggish.

			 The game averages about 10 FPS on the intro, around 30 FPS on the menu, and about 30 during play.Both Async and Sync work. Async is more stable and sounds better whilst Sync tends to slow the game down and sound worse. Enable Auto Frame Skip, Dynamic Recompilation, Double Optimisation, Clean Scene and Double Display Lists. Disable HLE, Memory Optimisation, Loop Optimisation. Over all the game runs smooth with Async sound with possibly a few frame drops in the menu and slow intro which finishes in a few seconds. Apart from that this is a great game to play being one of the best working ones for the DaedalusX64.

			  The game averages around 50-55 in intro, 45-50 in menu and 30-40 in game.Both Async and Sync work. Async is more stable and sounds better whilst Sync tends to slow the game down and sound worse. Enable Frameskip Auto 2, Dynamic Recompilation, HLE, Dynarec Memory Optimistation, Dynarec Loop Optimistation, Dynarec Doubles Optimistation, Clean Scene and Double Display Lists. Disable Texture Update Check. Overall the game runs smooth and sounds good with Async. With the only issues being occasional frame drops in games and a graphical bug in which the count down for the start of the race lags behind the game and sound. Apart from that this is a great game to play being one of the best working ones for the DaedalusX64.

			Texture Resizing seems to be causing rom issues. Textures will show if Bomberman is loaded first but it still looks corrupted. Both Sync and Async audio work for a split second, but it crashes the game, and if you get back to the DaedalusX64 menu, the sound can still be heard.

			The graphics actually look quite appealing, but in-game, some of the backgrounds are missing at some points during gameplay. Neither Async, nor Sync works, so leave them disabled. Set Frameskip to 1 to speed up the game a bit.  Sometimes the game hangs a bit, so there is a bit of instability during gameplay.

			    This game looks really good, and even though the speeds are not blazing fast, the game feels fast and is tolerable. I would recommend that you set Frameskip to Auto for a speed boost, and make sure to set Texture Update Check to Every Frame, so the text will become visible. Both Sync and Async audio work, but Async sounds a lot less choppy and robs less fps, so if you want audio, Async is the way to go.
Decent speeds without sound.

			 Async audio causes a BSOD upon boot, and with Sync Enabled, it won't boot, so make sure to leave audio Disabled. The graphics look terrible, and in-game, the background is black. You must have Dynamic Loop Optimization Disabled, or else it gets stuck at the Expansion Pak check. You also need to Enable Clean Scene or else all of the graphics flicker and have a trail. You might want to also set Frameskip to 1 for better speed, and although the speeds are low, it feels pretty fast.

			 Make sure to Disable Dynamic Loop Optimization or else the game will freeze before you get to the menu. There are a few graphical problems with the menu and the HUD, most likely due to the lack of framebuffer support, but nothing that could get in the way of gameplay. Set Texture Update Check to Every Frame to fix text. The speeds are fast in the menu, and decent during gameplay, but you might want to set Frameskip to Auto. The audio does work in this game, but is quite choppy. Sync works, but is choppy. Enabling Async audio causes this game to run at fullspeed, but the sound is still choppy, so if you want to Enable Async and turn down your PSP volume, that would give you a major speed boost.

			 Make sure to not Enable Async audio when loading the game because it causes the game to freeze slightly after it boots. Sync audio works quite well, but I would recommend to leave it disabled for speed purposes. The graphics look amazing, and I did not notice any graphical problems, but there may be some further into the game. The game is a bit slow, and the overall speed depends on how many objects are on the screen at any one moment. Set Frameskip to 1 for a speed increase.

The speeds in both the menu and the game are quite fast, but Frameskip should still be set to Auto. Both Sync and Async audio work without too much choppiness, so it is your choice if you want to Enable it or not. You can go in-game, but no graphics are rendered except for text, and if you have sound Enabled, that can be heard.

			This is one of the best games to play on DaedalusX64. The graphics are great, the speed is more than needed, and the sound is not choppy. Turn on Frame Limiter because the speeds often exceed 100% sync, but also set Frameskip to Auto because sometimes the speed dips a little. I did not notice any graphical problems at all during my playtime. If you want to enable audio, Async is a bit faster than Sync.

This game is definitely a must play. The game is fullspeed, even with sound enabled. I would recommend that you set Frame Limiter to Yes to slow down the game a bit. Both Async and Sync audio work, so whichever one you would like to play with is up to you. The graphics look just about like the game is being played on the original hardware. Not only is it pretty much perfectly emulated, it is also an addicting, fun game to play. You also might want to think about setting Frameskip to Auto because it doesn't hurt to have it on, but that's totally up to you.

Has some graphical issues with puzzle mode.

*This game runs at least 90% speed (during majority of gameplay) with very minor glitches and sound enabled.

			 The game plays excellent. It is fullspeed, practically graphically bug-free, and the sound is perfect. Both Sync and Async audio work fullspeed, so whichever one you would prefer is okay. Make sure to set Limit Framerate to Yes because sometimes the speeds can become overwhelming. Although the game is fullspeed with sound, you might experience framerate drops, so you might want to consider setting Frameskip to Auto, just in case. The graphics look good, and I did not see any bugs anywhere, but they may be further in the game.

			 The only graphical problem I saw was a little miscoloration of some of the text, other than that, the graphics are flawless. This game runs faster than fullspeed, so turn on Frame Limiter, and if you want to Enable sound, either Sync or Async will work without choppiness. If you do Enable sound, you may want to set Frameskip to Auto because the game will become just below fullspeed, and Auto should give it the minor boost it needs.

The speeds are a bit slow during the cutscenes and in the menu, so set Frameskip to 1 for a speed boost.

			You must Disable Dynamic Recompilation to run this game, or you can use this savestate (http://www.megaupload.com/?d=MGUA3MA3) to skip the Dynamic Recompilation freeze point. Once you get to the menu, you can Enable Dynamic Recompilation again because that is where most of DaedalusX64's speed comes from. The game is a bit slow, so set Frameskip to 1. The menu has a bunch of graphical problems, and there are a few invisible textures. The text is also jumbled if you do not set Texture Update Check to Every Frame, so do so. Both Sync and Async audio work, but leave them Disabled because they are very choppy. Upon entering a new game, the game will experience a BSOD and crash, so this game is still unplayable.

			You must have Dynamic Loop Optimization Disabled, or else whenever you select Puzzle Mode, the game will freeze. Async audio crashes the game, so if you want to Enable audio, then select Sync. The game is fast enough to have Sync audio enabled without any choppiness. The game runs above fullspeed at all times during the menu, so turn on Frame Limiter to slow it down. Enabling Sync audio also slows it down to about the right speed, but Frame Limiter is accurate. There are no graphical problems in the menu. The only thing wrong with this game is that upon entering a game, it crashes to a white screen.

			The game looks amazing, but there are a few graphical issues such as some text color and a few flickering/disappearing textures. I thought I would be able to get in-game without a hitch, but whenever you select Story Mode or whatever it is called, I do not understand Japanese, it goes to either create or load a game note, and is unable to do so, so a box of text appears and I am guessing it is saying something about the MemPak not being able to be read. You can still play a tutorial if you select the second option in the main menu. The game is really fast, but can slow to speeds just below fullspeed, so turn on Limit Framerate and set Frameskip to Auto. Both Sync and Async audio work well, so if you want to Enable sound, go ahead. I would recommend Async because it is faster. I'm sure if you had a savestate to get past the MemPak issue, you could probably get in-game.

My settings are all by default so I didn't change/enable/disable anything.

Game logos on startup with sound, seem choppy but load decent and logos seem a bit choppy

Menus: Without sound 75-80 FPS (dang!)
With Asynch sound: 19-20 FPS (very clear, not choppy)
With Synch sound: 19-21 FPS (seems more clear than Asynch) (I'm using this for sound)

Cursor to see selection, seems a bit screwed up but it is visible

Track selection under challenge, freestyle, exotica mode: Can't seem to see tracks selected except by name because of silver thing blocking it. (Applies to all sounds)

Options menu: can't see a thing (nothing is visible except cursor)

Automatic/Manual selection: Choppy when selecting what you want in terms of transmission since when you select manual then go back to automatic it overlaps text, but can tell what transmission selected by circular green thing

Car selection: black box seems to block what you ware see car you want, cars look choppy sometimes but give it 30 secs and it will be ok

FPS is still holding a 19-22 rate with no slowdown or music chopping.

Actual gameplay: some graphical errors, things seem to flickering like trees and such, road seems green at times (maybe it's because I selected the Korea track?) FPS dipped to 12 but it shoots 15-17, sound is choppy when passing through checkpoints

Overall:
it's definitely playable if you don't care about the interface being a bit choppy

in terms of the Daedalus color code you guys use, I'd probably put this as a Green, for it's playablity but still needs working a bit,

So here you guys go, have fun.

Turn off in-game HUD settings under Options -&gt; Screen Settings. Could speed it up a couple of FPS. HLE is the biggest saver, with it disabled your lucky to reach 10FPS at any part of the game, enabled you'll hit 30FPS in menus and 14FPS in a race.

			You must have HLE disabled, or else the game will crash upon entering the game. The graphics look good, and the only thing I see is a few cases of overlapping textures. The speed in-game is great, and really depends on where you are. Set Frameskip to Auto for a minor speed increase. Both Sync and Async audio work, but are a little choppy. It is up to you if you want to Disable it or not, but I would recommend Async because it is a few fps faster.

			You must have Dynamic Loop Optimization Disabled or else the game will freeze just before getting in-game. Async sound crashes the game, so make sure not to Enable it. Sync sound works though. There are not as many graphical problems as there used to be, but it's not flawless. Tiger's face still looks a bit jumbled up. The game is a bit slow, but is not too slow for this kind of game. I would recommend that you set Frameskip to Auto-1, pretty much the same thing, to speed the game up a little.

The game has a blue tint and most things are shadowed and not very visible. However, Your character can be seen. There are tons of random crash points, so the game is still very unstable.

The graphics will become visible by enabling Basic TMEM Emulation, although they are still rendered wrong. You need a savestate to get in game, but it is pretty much unplayable due to so many bugs. The sound does not work at all.
Recommended Settings:
Frameskip: Auto
Basic TMEM Emulation: Enabled

			 Graphics are great with a few minor bugs. The logo on the start up is kind of messed up. The start menu does not show but if you press "select" on the psp and leave the menu back to emulation it shows up perfectly. Moving text drags across the screen, Texture update fix's this but oddly you can turn it on then go back to emulation then turn texture update off, and the text still will not drag. Async and Sync sound works. Async does not work as well as Sync sound. Async sound is very choppy. Sync sound is almost flawless throughout the game!
Only time sync is any amount of choppy is during fights and it?s not that noticeable. This game is very playable at near or full speed with almost no graphic glitches!

			 Graphics wise, there seems to not be any problems, Sound crackles more than it should for the sync% (just under 50%) but works.
Because of the fast nature of the game, it doesn't visually appear to be running slow, at least if you don't turn the frameskip too high.
Software clipping is required.

In-Game: the map dissolves in and out leaving the background-only on most of the screen in many areas. this bug is unique in the sense that it's symptoms are similar to Software Clipping (off), yet it's unrelated.
(EDIT) remove z fighting fixes the gray randomly covering the track but causes depth issues like if you have it turned on in starfox.

			  The game runs at an exceptional speed, almost fullspeed, but you should still set Frameskip to Auto and Frame Limit to Yes. Both Async and Sync audio work well, but I would recommend Sync because Async is very choppy. The only thing that is wrong with the game is that when you get up to bat, the graphics begin to freak out and a blue flashing screen appears. Enabling Clean Scene stops the trailing and flickering, but it causes everything but the player and the pitcher to turn black. You can continue playing and this only occurs when you're up to bat.

			          The game is a must play on DaedalusX64, and a great dungeon crawler RPG. The only major graphical issue I see is that the pause menu is jumbled up, from the lack of framebuffer support, but does not hinder gameplay at all. You might want to turn on Clean Scene to fix a few "trails". Even though the game is in Japanese, the gameplay is easy to figure out. You might want to consider setting to controller to DPad because the controls are a bit awkward. The sound is great, but I recommend Async for faster speed, although Sync does work as well. With sound the game averages 100-130% sync, and without sound 115-150% sync. Although it is quite fast, it slows at some parts, so set Frameskip to Auto, and Limit the Framerate as well because speeds can become a bit excessive.

			    This game is almost perfect, graphically. The speeds are great in this game, and does not lose that much speed when multiple objects are on the screen. Both Sync and Async audio work quite nicely, but should remain Disabled if you don't want to lose any speed. Set Frameskip to Auto for a nice speed increase.

			Logo's &amp; menu's show ok, speed on the whole is very good, but the more on screen the slower the speed becomes, but can reach its full speed, graphics wise *Gex himself &amp; other objects / characters are not being rendered correctly only when he jumps, but the rest of the game seems to look perfect, sound seems to be slightly slow.
Settings used are...........
FS: 1, Limit FR: Enabled,
Audio: Sync (Async sounds choppy, but the speed is better with this enabled).

			  Game is running full speed! Gex's body is fixed and the game is definitely playable but has a some graphics errors and the audio is really bad on asynchronous but the game is faster with it on. I beat the first level full speed it was allot of fun
FPS range 32-42+ ( with Asynchronous but the audio is really bad with it set to asynchronous
FPS range  23-30  (with synchronous on great audio)

PSP Slim 5.00m33-6
best settings (for me):
Texture update - every-frame
frameskip - Auto 1
Limit framerate - No (recommended yes because gameplay gets a little too fast with asynchronous on but its funner when fast!)
Dynamic recompilation - enabled
Dynamic Stack Optimization - enabled
High Level Emulation - enabled
Memory Access Optimization - enabled
Audio -Asynchronous( recommended to put on Synchronous's almost perfect but the game is slower by a bit)

			The only noticeable graphical impairment is the red sky, other than that, the game looks awesome. The speeds are quite fast because although the fps are low, the fps needed for a fullspeed game are 20. Both Sync and Async work well, but it can be a bit choppy at times. Set Frameskip to Auto to combat some of the lag. The game works quite well, and feels very fast while playing.

			 The graphical issues with this game are so significant that the game is deemed unplayable, and this is due to the lack of framebuffer support. If you are determined to try to play this game, about 10 minutes of button mashing should get you in-game, but I have never made it past the very beginning of gameplay. With Async audio enabled, the results are just a bit slower than having it disabled, but Sync runs at the usual slow pace, although both do work. For the best results disable audio for a slight speed increase. You also might want to set Frameskip to Auto. Despite the graphics not working, the speed runs at a decent rate.

			  This is one of my favorite games on the Nintendo 64 and I cannot wait for this to run 100% speed! A lot of the graphical bugs from the last few versions are fixed. It looks really pretty now and frame rate is acceptable, however audio is very choppy.

Set Frameskip to Auto 1 and put Texture Update Check to Every Frame if you want to play.

Game slows down a couple of FPS when you enable Audio, and Audio is too choppy to be enjoyable. Game slows down when loading, but when it isn't loading it runs at low to mid 20's.

			The speed of this game really depends on if you are in the menu or in-game. The speeds in the menu are more than satisfactory, but once you get in-game, the speeds are horrendous, so you will need to set Frameskip to at least 1. The sound does work, but Async causes the game to pause, but if you switch to Sync or disable it, then you are able to continue playing without a crash. Sync sound works quite well, but should remain disabled to get all of the speed you can out of the game. The graphics look quite good in the game, and I didn't notice any graphical bugs that could hinder gameplay.

			Upon booting up the game, the menus run quite fast and look excellent. When selecting a new game, the game takes a while to load, and after a few moments, you must press X to get in-game. The graphics look good, except that you are unable too see your weapon at all. It is still easy to tell that you are damaging an enemy, but seeing where you were swinging might be nice. The speeds of this game definitely depend on many factors, such as how many enemies are on screen, what direction you are heading, or where you are looking. Set Frameskip to Auto to gain more speed when needed. The game feels a lot like Doom, but with a melee weapon instead of firearms. Both Sync and Async audio work quite well, depending on the speed at any one moment, and can go from clear to choppy in an instant, so it is your choice whether to Disable it or not. I would recommend Async if you want it enabled.

			  You must Disable Dynamic Loop Optimization or else the intro will continue to loop over and over. The screen has black all around it, so you might want to consider Zooming in to about 115%. The sound does not work at all for this game. I saw quite a bit of graphical bugs during my short time playing, but it's not atrocious. The speeds are decent in-game, but still set Frameskip to Auto because the fps fluctuates quite a bit. This game is definitely unplayable because the lack of microphone support, and you can only get so far before being asked to plug in the mic.

			  Game loads up good, but after it asks you if you want to start a save file the screen is just black with sound until you hit a button. The main menu needs to be constantly updated to stop it from turning into a mess on screen, In-game graphics seem to be pretty good, I don't notice any graphic bugs while racing, speed varies alot in this game, on the outdoor area's it can run to the 26 fps, but in a tunnel it drops to as low as 8 fps.

			You must have Texture Update Check set to Every Frame or else the text seems to become jumbled and blends together. The speeds are decent in-game, but you still need to set Frameskip to Auto for more speed. The menus look decent, but at some times they become black and hard to navigate. In-game, the cars seem to be flying on the straightaways, and you often run into invisible walls the inhibit gameplay quite a bit. These invisible walls are hard to navigate, so good luck. Both Sync and Async audio work, and they sound quite good for the speed. I would still recommend that you leave audio disabled for speed purposes.

			The graphics look okay, but the menu options seem to be a bit out of place. The characters seems to jerk around, sometimes disappear and fall over, and sometimes have trails, but no option will fix this. I tried enabling both Texture Update Check and Clean Scene, but neither of these fixed the issue. Other than these issues, the graphics look good. Both Sync and Async audio do work, but they both just emit an annoying, high-pitched whine, so leave the sound Disabled. The speeds in-game are very slow, so set Frameskip to 1 to combat the speed issues. I was able to get far into the game without any crahsing, so you probably will not experience any random crashes.

			You must have Async Enabled to boot the game! The good thing about having Async sound enabled, is that it is perfect, absolutely no crackling at all, so leave it on at all times. Sync sound or Disabling audio causes the game to crash. The graphics look quite good, and I did not notice certain bugs that I had in times past. The only thing that affects gameplay, is the speed. The speed in-game is a bit unbearable, but setting Frameskip to 1 will give you a few extra fps.

			There are a few minor graphical glitches, such as whenever you get in-game, the menu can be seen behind the screen. To help remove the menu, you might want to set Zoom to around 115%. The cars look good, but there are a few other graphical bugs throughout the game. Both Sync and Async audio work, but Async causes the fps to fluctuate wildly, not reflecting actual speeds of course. I would recommend that you leave the sound Disabled because the speed in-game can get very slow. Set Frameskip to 1 to help with the speeds. One glitch that could deem this game unstable is that if you stop accelerating and slow down your car enough, the game will freeze.

			   The game feels like it is going to be playable, but when you select to start the game in the main menu, it resets itself. No matter the preferences selected this prohibits you from going in game. Async audio freezes the rom, so if you choose to play sound, make sure to select Sync.

			        Characters are not displayed correctly on the main menu, but in-game graphics look great and you get generally around 20-30 FPS with sound disabled and 16-26 with it enabled, there seems to be a vast improvement in speed in game overall, but depends on which track you are racing on, and how much is on screen.
Sadly other racers still disappear as they move away from your car.

			         The game runs really well, but can be really slow in some parts like Kokiri Forest ( 6 9 FPS ), Hyrule is probably fastest ( 12-18 FPS ), but is good.

			                 - Set Texture Update Check to Every 3 Frames, to me seems to be a good texture update setting, allows you to view text with a .5 to 1 frame speed up.
- Auto Frameskip is recommended.
- Recommended without sound. Fps usually spikes way up inside small places or dungeons, then you can use sound.
- Still some freezing points but can be gotten around if you try to get past enough times.
REMEMBER: Kokiri Forest (and near it) is generally the slowest area in the game.

I tested comparing to LoZ 1.0, while its rumored the GC versions run slightly faster, I can confirm this one runs slightly slower than 1.0. Starting house ran about 3-4 FPS slower. Starting village ran about half a FPS slower.for this game just use Dynamic recoliation,none of the other stuff seems to speed this up

			 The game seems to freeze at random times during gameplay, so make sure to save frequently. The game is not too fast as it averages 10 fps, about 33% sync. As I can see there are no graphical issues that can be easily noticed. Both Async and Sync audio work, but Async is recommended because it is a bit more speedy than Sync. Remember to keep audio disabled for a slight speed increase. Make sure to disable Increase IV Event as it robs 4-5 fps from the game.

			The game only allows you to go to the menu, and won't actually advance to the game play. The game freezes instantly if you choose play now, and allows you to get a bit further if you choose advanced settings, then freezes before you actually get in-game. Sync audio is much faster than Async (both work). I did not see any major graphical problems in the menu, but I'm not to sure about in-game.

When you are in battle the game goes 85-100%.(25-30fps average) But when you're walking, the game goes 50%-85%.(15-24fps average) 

TIP: When making an action command (jump, walk, hammer etc.), it suddenly just slows down the game by so much. What you can do is that for example: if you walk, you keep on walking so that the game will stay in good speed but even though you stop or do anything else the game will go down by 15fps!

			  Game starts up fine, graphics are pretty good I don't notice anything in-game except a few images show no color. This game is very playable. 
(follow the bellow tip)
Enable Async audio, which will give 50-80% speed up!
Settings : 
FrameSkip : Disabled, 
Limit Framerate : 
Enabled, Async Audio.
Framerate is really low but sync% is 90-120% ! ( Using the above method )
Sound is really bad, I recommend to turned down your PSP volume.
This will eventually crash the game.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOonUPY8AiI video for camera solution 
the solution is to rename a savegame for example = Pokemon Snap (S) [!]. ss so Pokemon Snap (S) [!]. game runs very well when i changed some of the settings but they dont change alot of the graphic and fps errors probably not able to be fixed until newer Revs enjoy.

			   First off, on starting up all logo's &amp; main screen display correctly, next the main menu with the 3 options, seem to be the only menu that do not look correct, as "Corn" mentioned is due to lack of framebuffer effects, also seem to be a couple of inexact blends in places.
Recommended settings for best results:

TUC: Every Frame, (Makes no difference to the glitches in game sadly).
Frameskip: Auto 1, Limit Framerate: Yes,
High Level Emu: Disabled, (Seems to crash emulation if enabled).
Audio: *Async, (Only enable if you can stand jerky gameplay, but does sound excellent).
Controller: Default, (Press 'O' &amp; Dpad directions to move cursor in menu's).
Dyn Mem Opt: Enabled,
Dyn Loop Opt: Enabled,

			 Game starts up fine, but once you get in-game there are a bunch of graphic bugs! Such as being able to see a lot of objects through walls. Lighting is not properly displayed. Some objects don?t even show up at all until you get really close to them! Your weapons don?t show too often. Textures look really bad when you get close or sometimes they look bad all the time. Some lettering is glitchy. Async and sync sound both work but are very choppy. This game is playable with some major graphic glitches.

			        Runs very well, the speed seems to be improving with each new revision, in fact so much so, its only on average 5 fps, from top speed while in game, but you do lose speed depending on what's on screen at times.
When using Sync audio in game, music &amp; effects sound perfect, that is until the replay starts LOL :o)
Make sure to set Viewport size: 16:9 stretch (480x272) - Cures tachometer problem,
there also seems to be a couple of problems viewing the rear view mirror while in car, and the map while driving is not shown correctly.
Top Tip (Thanks kakarotto)
Turn off the following 2 options for a big boost in speed -
Dpad Left - turn off/on mirror while in car view
Dpad Right - turn off/on map (But can also be turned on/off in options in main menu)

			 The logo's &amp; main menu show correctly, the selection screens seem to be ok, apart from the car selection screen, which displays all wrong graphics on the cars themselves.
In-game the tracks and cars are not displayed correctly, at the start of the races, the cars &amp; tracks show ok, until they move, and everything disappears, there are a few inexact blends showing in places, including main title screen.
Settings used in this title are:
FS: 2, Audio: Disabled (Sound doesn't work at all with Async or Sync).

There are huge speed differences in play modes:
In Practice mode: fps 25-30 (Full Speed)
In Race mode: fps 13-20 (With Frameskip set to Auto 1 then fps: 17-24) 

I would recommend these settings:~

Frameskip: Auto 1(gives the game a nice speed up)

			   Game will not start unless *Async sound is enabled. If you try to change to sync or disable, the game will not start. This game is showing a lot better speed getting up to 21 fps, which this game has not reached before,  when the screen with the mask is reached it seems to freeze, but just takes a long time to continue, meanwhile the sound continues on. Audio seems perfect including music, movement in game is very jerky, especially when there are a lot on screen, and it slows the game down to its minimum 7fps, then suddenly it can speed up, resulting in the jerky movement i mentioned before.
Settings used on this game are..........
TextUpdCheck: Every 20 Frames, FS: 1,
Audio: Async (Please note - Do NOT change type of audio or disable).
Advanced options are........
Increase VI event: Enabled, 
DDList: Enabled (to reduce the amount of jerky movement).
Tip.......**When in game go to options and change from Hi-Res to Lo-Res, to speed up game or in Global settings change texture filter to "Force Nearest Filter".

make sure limit framerate is on or otherwise you are going to have 3000% sync and the game will be rendured unplayable

Enable Double Display Lists or video will skip backwards every couple seconds.
Many things such as vehicles and menu items, don't show. You can keep pressing "A" at the start of the game to enter a race at least. Buttons will have to be pressed for a second or two to work. While boosting the game does some weird stuff with the borders of the screen.

I would recommend leaving the sound off to boost what little framerate you can get from it. Otherwise the sound is extremely choppy. All in all the game runs very slowly (only about 25% speed).

			     Keep settings at default (except for maybe the controller). Game play is nearly identical to the USA version, if you are familiar with that version you would be able to play this one.

*Async is faster, but often crashes. Sync is slower, but more stable. Disable for better speed.

**On some levels it will go a little slower with sound on, but with it off it will be close to full speed.

*** Seems to be a bit better than the original in terms of graphic quality, although this may not be true. Some of the Japanese Characters in the game would occasionally flicker, don't know if it makes it unreadable, since I cant read Japanese.

			    This game will not boot up unless you have sound disabled! If you have any sound enabled at boot up you will get a glitched up start menu and then nothing. Start up with sound disabled to get past the start menu. This game has a lot of graphical glitches such as images not displayed correctly, lots of images are flashing and glitchy. In-game graphics seem to be decent besides a few images not being transparent and there are some white bars that flicker on the screen. You can enable Sync sound after start up but it is VERY choppy. If you enable Async sound the game crashes shortly after. This game is playable with some moderated to major graphic glitches.

Both Sync and Async work, but the sound is too choppy to be enjoyable, so leave it Disabled for more speed. The controls are a bit hard to grasp as well.

			 The graphics do not get rendered, but with a bit of button mashing, text does appear on screen. It says that it is trying to read the controller pak, and hangs soon afterward. The audio does work with both Sync and Async. I suspect that this might be the result of a possible regression.

			 The menus look pretty bad due to the lack of framebuffer support. Other than the menu graphics, the game looks pretty good. The speed is quite slow, but the gameplay feels close to fullspeed. Async sound is extremely choppy, so I would recommend that the audio be left disabled. I was able to get in-game and open up a can of whoop-ass without any random freezes, so the game seems quite stable.

Recommended Settings:
Frameskip: Auto

			The logo's look correct, the credits when they start to roll don't look quite right, but overall the main game works nearly perfect, just the options screen and a few other information screens don't look quite right, wrong colours etc etc..........BUT in game and in demo mode the graphics are perfect &amp; run as near damn it full speed, wait for it......with Async audio enabled as well.
Please note........There seem to be problems with the intro's of the wrestlers, flickering/dark visuals depending on the wrestler, but enabling Clean scene in advanced options cures this problem, but at a slight speed reduction.

			Game starts up fine but the screen will sometimes be shaky unless you enabled Double Display. Menu graphics seem to be good besides a few black spots and a glitched looking right side at the menu. In-game graphics is where things start to look real messy. The sky is often display with lots of repeating clouds and is black and sometimes is displayed as white. Some things such as tree's are displayed as black. (Yes I tried texture update) Character motion will not display unless texture update is on. Async and sync sound both work but are very choppy. This game is playable with some major graphic errors.

			   This game starts up fine but has some minor graphic errors. In-game graphics seem to be pretty good besides annoying grey blocks that keep on appearing on the screen. Other minor graphic errors seem to be mainly just inexact blends on the explosions. This game is playable depending on if you can deal with very slow gameplay, which seems to be slower than previous revisions.
Settings on this game are:
FS: 1 or 2, Audio: Async or Sync (Disabled is recommended).

			  You must have Dynamic Loop Optimization Disabled or else the game will crash immediately after you enter your character's name. This slows down emulation by 10-20fps, so after you get past the freeze point you may want to Enable it again. Make frequent savestates just in case the game freezes at some point further in-game, which can most likely be fixed by Disabling Dynamic Loop Optimization again. The game runs at a decent speed, and can gain a bit more by setting Frameskip to Auto. Both Sync and Async audio work, and the choppiness depends on the framerate. The graphics look flawless, but there might be an incorrect blendmode or two somewhere deep in-game. The game actually takes a long time to get in-game from the point where you press start in the main menu, but be patient and you will be able to play it.
